Bockchain Technology

--------------------------------------------------------

A blockchain is a distributed, immutable, and decentralized ledger at its core that consists of a chain of blocks and each block contains a set of data. The blocks are linked together using cryptographic techniques and form a chronological chain of information. The structure of a blockchain is designed to ensure the security of data through its consensus mechanism which has a network of nodes that agree on the validity of transactions before adding them to the blockchain.

Blocks:
A block in a blockchain is a combination of three main components: 

1. The header contains metadata such as a timestamp which has a random number used in the mining process and the previous block's hash. 

2. The data section contains the main and actual information like transactions and smart contracts which are stored in the block. 

3. Lastly, the hash is a unique cryptographic value that works as a representative of the entire block which is used for verification purposes.

In recent years, you may have noticed many businesses around the world integrating Blockchain technology. But how exactly does Blockchain technology work? Is this a significant change or a simple addition? The advancements of Blockchain are still young and have the potential to be revolutionary in the future; so, let’s begin demystifying this technology.

Blockchain is a combination of three leading technologies:

Cryptographic keys
A peer-to-peer network containing a shared ledger
A means of computing, to store the transactions and records of the network
Cryptography keys consist of two keys – Private key and Public key. These keys help in performing successful transactions between two parties. Each individual has these two keys, which they use to produce a secure digital identity reference. This secured identity is the most important aspect of Blockchain technology. In the world of cryptocurrency, this identity is referred to as ‘digital signature’ and is used for authorizing and controlling transactions.

The digital signature is merged with the peer-to-peer network; a large number of individuals who act as authorities use the digital signature in order to reach a consensus on transactions, among other issues. When they authorize a deal, it is certified by a mathematical verification, which results in a successful secured transaction between the two network-connected parties. So to sum it up, Blockchain users employ cryptography keys to perform different types of digital interactions over the peer-to-peer network.
